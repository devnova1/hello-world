Hello People,
My name is Elvin..  Today is 03/18/2017 and this is my first personal github account.
I'm starting this becase I was to learn how to develop websites.  I'm looking to start this as a hobby and soon make some money from this hobby.  When I get comfortable enough, I intended on starting a small business and eventually quit my day job.
Right now I'm not a strong programmer, but I know I will be soon.  I have a MS degree in Information Systems.  I currently work in a manufacturing company as one of four IT guys.  I mainly work on report writing, sharepoint development, LMS implamentation and ERP helpdesk tickets.   More important than all of that is I checked out a text book from my local public library on learning PHP, MySQL, Javascript, CSS and HTML.  I'm reading the book cover to cover, while taking notes and practicing on a SaaS IDE.
That's all for now.
Catch you later, humans!
